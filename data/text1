Vim  is a text editor that is upwards compatible to Vi.  It can be used
to edit all kinds of plain text.  It is especially useful  for  editing
programs.

There  are a lot of enhancements above Vi: multi level undo, multi win-
dows and buffers, syntax highlighting, command line  editing,  filename
completion,   on-line   help,   visual  selection,  etc..   See  ":help
vi_diff.txt" for a summary of the differences between Vim and Vi.

While running Vim a lot of help can be obtained from the  on-line  help
system,  with the ":help" command.  See the ON-LINE HELP section below.
